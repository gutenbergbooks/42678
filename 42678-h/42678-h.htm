          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Half-dazed, and dazzled by the light,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>At first it seemed I'd only find</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A broken pane, a flapping blind:</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>I saw a naked boy upon the bed,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Who crouched and shuddered on the folded sheet;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, on his face, before my feet,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A naked man, who lay as if quite dead,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Though on his broken knuckles blood was red:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And all my wits awakened at the sight.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>I set the lantern down; and took the child,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Who looked at me, with piteous eyes and wild;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And chafed his chill, wet body, till it glowed;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And forcing spirit 'twixt his chattering teeth,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I tucked him snugly in beneath</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The blankets, and soon left him warmly stowed:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And stooped to tend the man, who lay</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Still senseless on the floor.</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>I turned him off his face;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And laid him on the other bed;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And washed and staunched his wound.</span>

            <span>And yet for all that I could do,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I could not bring him to,</span>

            <span>Or see a trace</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of life returning to that heavy head.</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>It seemed he'd swooned,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When through the window he'd made way,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Just having strength to lay</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The boy in safety. Still as death,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He lay, without a breath:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And seeing I could do no more</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To help him in the fight for life;</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>I turned again to tend the lad;</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>To find him sleeping quietly.</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>So, fetching fuel, I lit a fire:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And quickly had as big a blaze</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>As any housewife could desire:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, 'twixt the beds, I set a chair,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>That I might watch until they stirred:</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>The sleeping boy, and him who lay</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>In that strange stiller sleep, 'twas plain</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>That they were son and father, now</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I'd time to look, and wonder how,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>In such a desperate plight,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Without a stitch or rag,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They'd taken refuge from the night.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as I wondered drowsily,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>It seemed yet queerer and more queer;</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>For round the Head the rocks are sheer,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>With scarce a foothold for a bird;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And it seemed quite beyond belief</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>That any wrecked upon the reef,</span>

            <span>Could swim ashore, and scale the crag,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>I found the man was sitting up in bed:</span>

            <span>And talking to himself, with wide, unseeing eyes.</span>

            <span>Grew calm: and, straining, I could hear</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>His engine. All the other men</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Were up--for things were slack just then--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And I'd one foot upon the cage;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When, all at once, I caught the smell</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of burning. Even as I turned</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To see what it could be that burned,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The seam behind was choked with stife.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And so I dropped on hands and knees,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And crawled along the gallery,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beneath the smoke, that I might see</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>What ailed: and as I crept, half-blind,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With smarting eyes, and breath awheeze,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I scarcely knew what I should find.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>At times, I thought I'd never know...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And 'twas already quite an age</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Since I set out ... I felt as though</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I had been crawling all my life</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beneath the stifling cloud of smoke</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That clung about me fit to choke:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And when, at last, I'd struggled here,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>'Twas long ere I could see things clear...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That he was lying here ... and he</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was dead ... and burning like a tree...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A tree-trunk soaked in oil ... No doubt,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The engine had caught fire, somehow;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And when he tried to put it out,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His greasy clothes had caught ... and now</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As fine a lad as you could see...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And such a lad for singing ... I</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had heard him when I worked hard by;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And often quiet I would sit</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To hear him, singing in the pit,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As though his heart knew naught of it,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And life was nothing but a song.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>"He'd not been working with us long:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And little of his ways I knew:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, when I'd got him up, at last;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And he was lying in the shed,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The sweet song silent in his breast;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And there was nothing more to do:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The notion came into my head</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That he had always been well-dressed;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And seemed a neat and thrifty lad...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And lived in lodgings ... so, maybe,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Would carry on him all he had.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>So, back into the cage I stepped:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, when it reached the bottom, crept</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Along the gallery again</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, in the dust where he had lain,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I rummaged, until I found all</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That from his burning pockets fell.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And when it seemed there was no more,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I thought how, happy and alive,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>And recking naught what might befall,</span>

            <span>That now and then he had to wait awhile</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>For Janey, lagging like a little fool:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, when they'd covered near another mile</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Through that bewildering white without a sound,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Save rustling, rustling, rustling all around;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And all his well-known world, so queer and dim,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>He waited until she caught up to him;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And felt quite glad that he was not alone.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And when they reached the low, half-buried stone</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That marked where some old shepherd had been found,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Lost in the snow in seeking his lost sheep,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>One wild March night, full forty years ago,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He wished, and wished, that they were safe and sound</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In their own house: and as the snow got deeper,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And every little bank seemed strangely steeper,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He thought, and thought of that lost sleeper;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And saw him lying in the snow,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till every fleecy clump of heath</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Seemed to shroud a man beneath;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now his blood went hot and cold</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Through very fear of that dread sight;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then he felt that, in sheer fright,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He must take to his heels in flight,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He cared not whither, so that it might be</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Where there were no more bundles, cold and white,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Like sheeted bodies, plain to see.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, all on edge, he turned to chide</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His sister, dragging at his side:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, when he found that she was crying,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Because her feet and hands were cold,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He quite forgot to scold:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And spoke kind words of cheer to her:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And saw no more dead shepherds lying</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In any snowy clump of heather.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>So, hand in hand, they trudged together,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Through that strange world of drifting gloam,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Sharp-set and longing sore for home.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And John remembered how that morning,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When they set out the sky was blue--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Clean, cloudless blue; and gave no warning;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And how through air as clear as glass,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The far-off hills he knew</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Looked strangely near; and glittered brightly;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Each sprig of heath and blade of grass</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In the cold wind blowing lightly,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Each clump of green and crimson moss</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Sparkling in the wintry sun.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>But now, as they toiled home, across</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>These unfamiliar fells, nigh done,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The wind again began to blow;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And thicker, thicker fell the snow:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till Janey sank, too numb to stir:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When John stooped down, and lifted her,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To carry her upon his back.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then his head began to tire:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And soon he seemed to lose the track...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now the world was all afire...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Now dazzling white, now dazzling black...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then, through some strange land of light,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Where clouds of butterflies all white,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Fluttered and flickered all about,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Dancing ever in and out,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He wandered, blinded by white wings,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That rustled, rustled in his ears</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With cold, uncanny whisperings...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then it seemed his bones must crack</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With that dead weight upon his back...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When, on his cheek, he felt warm tears,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And a cold tangle of wet hair;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And knew 'twas Janey weeping there:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, taking heart, he stumbled on,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>While in his breast the hearthlight shone:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And it was all of his desire</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To sit once more before the fire;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And feel the friendly glowing heat.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, as he strove with fumbling feet,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>It seemed that he would never find</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Again that cheery hearth and kind;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But wander ever, bent and blind,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beneath his burden through the night</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of dreadful, spangly, whispering white.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>The wind rose; and the dry snow drifted</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In little eddies round the track:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And when, at last, the dark cloud rifted,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He saw a strange lough, lying cold and black,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>'Mid unknown, ghostly hills; and knew</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That they were lost: and once again,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The snow closed in: and swept from view</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The dead black water and strange fells.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>But still he struggled on: and then,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When he seemed climbing up an endless steep</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And ever slipping, sliding back,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With ankles aching like to crack,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And only longed for sleep;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He heard a tinkling sound of bells,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That kept on ringing, ringing, ringing,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Until his dizzy head was singing;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And he could think of nothing else:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then it seemed the weight was lifted</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>From off his back; and on the ground</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His sister stood, while, all around</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Were giants clad in coats of wool,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With big, curled horns, and queer black faces,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Who bobbed and curtsied in their places,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With blazing eyes and strange grimaces;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But never made a sound;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then nearly shook themselves to pieces,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Shedding round a smell of warm, wet fleeces:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then one it seemed as if he knew,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Looking like the old lame ewe,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Began to bite his coat, and pull</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till he could hardly stand: its eyes</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Glowing to a monstrous size,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till they were like a lantern light</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Burning brightly through the night...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>When someone stooped from out the sky,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To rescue him; and set him high:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And he was riding, snug and warm,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In some king's chariot through the storm,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Without a sound of wheel or hoof--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In some king's chariot, filled with straw,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>And he would nevermore be cold...</span>

        </div>
        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then with wondering eyes he saw</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Deep caverns of pure burning gold;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And knew himself in fairyland:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But when he stretched an eager hand</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To touch the glowing walls, he felt</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A queer warm puff, as though of fire...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And suddenly he smelt</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The reek of peat; and looking higher,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He saw the old, black porridge-kettle,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Hanging from the cavern roof,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Hanging on its own black crook:</span>

            <span>While by his side,</span>

            <span>With tender look,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His mother knelt;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And he had only one desire</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Were held by spell of fire quite blind</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To that black world that fell behind,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A cindery wilderness of death;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As he drew slowly near and nearer,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And saw the ovens glowing clearer--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Low-domed and humming hives of heat--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And felt the blast of burning breath</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That quivered from each white-hot brick:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till, blinded by the blaze, and sick</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He dropped into a welcome seat</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of warm white ashes, sinking low</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To soak his body in the glow</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That shot him through with prickling pain,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>An eager agony of fire,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Delicious after the cold ache,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And scorched his tingling, frosted skin.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then gradually the anguish passed;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And blissfully he lay, at last,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Without an unfulfilled desire,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His grateful body drinking in</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Warm, blessed, snug forgetfulness.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And yet, with staring eyes awake,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As though no drench of heat could slake</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His thirst for fire, he watched a red</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Hot eye that burned within a chink</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Between the bricks: while overhead</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The quivering stream of hot, gold air</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Surged up to quench the cold starlight.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>His brain, too numbed and dull to think</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Throughout the day, in that fierce glare</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Awoke, at last, with startled stare</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of pitiless, insistent sight</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That stript the stark, mean, bitter strife</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of his poor, broken, wasted life,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Crippled from birth, and struggling on,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The last, least shred of hope long gone,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To some unknown, black, bitter end.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, even as he looked, his brain</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Sank back to sightless sloth again;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, all at once, he seemed to choke;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And knew it was the stealthy stife</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And deadly fume of burning coke</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That filled his lungs, and seemed to soak</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Through every pore, until the blood</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Grew thick and heavy in his veins,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And he could scarcely draw a breath.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He lay, and murmured drowsily,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With closing eyes: "If this be death,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>It's snug and easy ... let it come...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>For life is cold and hard ... the flood</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Is rising with the heavy rains</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That pour and pour ... that damned old drum,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Why ever can't they let it be...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beat-beating, beating, beating, beat..."</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, suddenly, he sat upright,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>For, close behind him in the night,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He heard a breathing loud and deep,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And caught a whiff of burning leather.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He shook himself alive, and turned;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And on a heap of ashes white,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>O'ercome by the full blast of heat,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Where fieriest the dread blaze burned,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He saw a young girl stretched in sleep.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He sat awhile with heavy gaze</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Fixed on her in a dull amaze,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Until he saw her scorched boots smoking:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then, whispering huskily: "She's dying,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>While I look on and watch her choking!"</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He roused: and pulled himself together:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And rose, and went where she was lying:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, bending o'er the senseless lass,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>In his weak arms he lifted her;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And bore her out beyond the glare,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beyond the stealthy, stifling gas,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Into the fresh and eager air:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And laid her gently on the ground</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beneath the cold and starry sky:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And did his best to bring her round;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Though still, for all that he could try,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She seemed, with each deep-labouring breath</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Just brought up on the brink of death.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He sought, and found an icy pool,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Though he had but a cap to fill,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And bathed her hands and face, until</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The troubled breath was quieter,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And her flushed forehead felt quite cool:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then he saw an eyelid stir;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And shivering she sat up at last,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And looked about her sullenly.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>"I'm cold ... I'm mortal cold," she said:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>"What call had you to waken me?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>I was so warm and happy, dead...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And still those staring stars!" Her head</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Dropt in her hands: and thick and fast</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The tears came with a heavy sobbing.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He stood quite helpless while she cried;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And watched her shaken bosom throbbing</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With passionate, wild, weak distress,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till it was spent. And then she dried</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Her eyes upon her singed black dress;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Looked up, and saw him standing there,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Wondering, and more than half-afraid.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But now, the nipping, hungry air</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Took hold of her, and struck fear dead.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She only felt the starving sting</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That must, at any price, be stayed;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And cried out: "I am famishing!"</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Then from his pocket he took bread</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That he had been too weak and sick</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To eat o'ernight: and eager-eyed,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She took it timidly; and said:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>"I have not tasted food two days."</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, as he waited by her side,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He watched her with a quiet gaze;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And saw her munch the broken crust</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>So gladly, seated in the dust</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Of that black desert's bitter night,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Beneath the freezing stars, so white</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And hunger-pinched: and at the sight</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Keen pity touched him to the quick;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Although he never said a word,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Till she had finished every crumb.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then he led her to a seat</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A little closer to the heat,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But well beyond the deadly stife.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And in the ashes, side by side,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They sat together, dazed and dumb,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With eyes upon the ovens' glare,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Each looking nakedly on life.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And then, at length, she sighed, and stirred,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Still staring deep and dreamy-eyed</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Into the whitening, steady glow.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With jerky, broken words and slow,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And biting at her finger-ends,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She talked at last: and spoke out all</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Quite open-heartedly, as though</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>There were not any stranger there--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The fire and he, both bosom-friends.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She'd left her home three months ago--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She, country-born and country-bred,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">

          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And so no country place could please...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And she had worried without rest</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Until, at last, she got her ends;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, wiser than her folk and friends,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She left her home among the trees...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The trees grew thick for miles about</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Her father's house ... the forest spread</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>As far as ever you could see...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And it was green, in Summer, green...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Since she had left her home, she'd seen</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>No greenness could compare with it...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And everything was fresh and clean,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And not all smutched and smirched with smoke</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>They burned no sooty coal and coke,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But only wood-logs, ash and oak...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And by the fire at night they'd sit...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Ah! wouldn't it be rare and good</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To smell the sappy, sizzling wood,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Once more; and listen to the stream</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That runs just by the garden-gate...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And often, in a Winter spate,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She'd wakened from a troubled dream,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And lain in bed, and heard it roar;</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And quaked to hear it, as a child...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>It seemed so angry, and so wild--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Just mad to sweep the house away!</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And now, it was three months or more</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Since she had heard it, on the day...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The day she left ... and Michael stood...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>He was a woodman, too, and he</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Worked with her father in the wood...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And wanted her, she knew ... but she</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was proud, and thought herself too good</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To marry any country lad...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>'Twas queer to think she'd once been proud--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And such a little while ago--</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>A beggar, wolfing crusts! ... The pride</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>That made her quit her countryside</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Soon left her stranded in the crowd...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And precious little pride she had</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To keep her warm these freezing days</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Since she had fled the city-ways</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To walk back home ... aye! home again:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>For, in the town, she'd tried in vain,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>For honest work to earn her bread...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>At one place, they'd nigh slaved her dead,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And starved her, too; and, when she left,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had cheated her of half her wage:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But she'd no means to stop the theft...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And she'd had no more work to do...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Two months since, now ... it seemed an age!</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>How she had lived, she scarcely knew...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And still, poor fool, too proud to write</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To home for help, until, at length,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She'd not a penny for a bite,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Or pride enough to clothe her back...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>So, she was tramping home, too poor</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To pay the train-fare ... she'd the strength,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>If she'd the food ... but that hard track,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And that cold, cruel, bitter night</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Had taken all the heart from her...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>If Michael knew, she felt quite sure...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>For she would rather drop stone-dead</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Than live as some ... if she had cared</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>To feed upon the devil's bread,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She could have earned it easily...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She'd pride enough to starve instead,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Aye, starve, than fare as some girls fared...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>But, that was all behind ... and she</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Was going home ... and yet, maybe,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>If they'd a home like hers, they, too,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Would be too proud ... she only knew</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>The thought of home had kept her straight,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And saved her ere it was too late.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>She'd soon be home again...</span>

          <div class="inner line-block">
            <div class="line">
              <span>And now</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>She sat with hand upon her brow;</span>

            <span>And did not speak again nor stir.</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">

          <div class="line">
            <span>Still set upon the steady glare,</span>

            <span>His thoughts turned back to city-ways:</span>

            <span>That he had seen in city nights:</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And, once again, in early June,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Of young girls, children yet in years,</span>

            <span>With gaudy ribbons in their hair,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">

          <div class="line">
            <span>Who walked the pavements of despair,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Beneath the fair full Summer moon...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Shadowed by worn-out, wizened hags,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>With claw-hands clutching filthy rags</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>About old bosoms, shrunk and thin,</span>

            <span>And mouths aleer without a tooth,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>Who dogged them, cursing their sleek youth</span>

            <span>Then, in a reek of hot gas light,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>The greasy landlord, fat with sin,</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>Just half-way up the brothel stair,</span>

        <div class="line-block outermost">
          <div class="line">

            <span>And turning from the ovens' glare,</span>

            <span>He looked into her dreaming face;</span>

          <div class="line">
            <span>And saw green, sunlit woodlands there,</span>
          </div>
          <div class="line">
            <span>And waters flashing in between</span>

            <span>Of cold dawn shivered through the air:</span>
